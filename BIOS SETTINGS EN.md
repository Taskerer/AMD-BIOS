## CPU Common Options

#### RedirectForReturnDis = Auto
???

#### Platform First Error Handling = Disabled
A technology where system errors are handled first by the platform (processor or chipset) rather than by the operating system. For regular users, it can be left as **Disabled** since operating systems are generally quite efficient at handling errors.

#### Core Performance Boost = Auto
Disabling CPU turbo boost

#### Global C-state Control = Enabled
Energy-saving states of the processor, where parts of the processor can temporarily shut down or transition to lower power modes to save energy. **Enabled** is a good choice for most users as it allows reducing energy consumption without significantly impacting performance. If you want to maximize performance (e.g., for high-load workstations or gaming systems), you can choose **Disabled**, but this will increase energy consumption and heat output.

#### Opcache Control = Enabled
A cache for frequently used processor instructions that helps speed up program execution. Choosing **Enabled** is recommended for most users as it increases performance through more efficient use of the instruction cache. **Disabled** might be useful only in specific scenarios where special control over the processor is required (e.g., for debugging).

#### SEV ASID Count = Auto
???

#### SEV-ES ASID Space Limit Control = Auto
???

#### Streaming Stores Control = Enabled
Optimization for data write operations, allowing the processor to skip writing to the cache and directly write data to RAM. **Enabled** is recommended for applications that work actively with large volumes of data and frequently write to memory (e.g., scientific computations, databases, rendering). In regular user systems, it can be left as **Disabled** if there's no need for data write optimization.

#### Local APIC Mode = Auto
???

#### ACPI _CST C1 Declaration = Enabled
This relates to power management through ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface). C1 is one of the power-saving modes, known as the "halt" state. Enabling this option allows the operating system to declare support for this state, which can help improve power savings. It's generally better to leave this Enabled so the system can use all power-saving capabilities.

#### MCA error thresh enable = True
???

#### MCA error thresh count = Stock value
???

#### SMU and PSP Debug Mode = Auto
???

#### PPIN Opt-in = Disabled
This is a unique processor identifier that can be used for identification and tracking. Enabling this option allows the operating system or other programs to access this identifier. If you are concerned about privacy and do not use applications that require this information, it is better to leave it Disabled.
